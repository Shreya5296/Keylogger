# Keylogger

Run the keylogger.py
Save keylogger.py and send_email.py in the same location

Due to google secure authentication, when you run the keylogger file, it may or may not send the mail
If it does not work, then we need to change the Gmailsettings
Follow these steps to enable it to send messages:
● Open your gmail account(admin)
● Go to your Gmail Account
● On the left navigation panel, click Security.
● On the bottom of the page, in the “Less secure app access panel”, click Turn on access.
● Click the Save button

For MAC

Go to System Preferences
Go to Security & Privacy
Click the lock to make changes
Go to accessibility click on terminal
